# Advanced Graph-Based Deep Learning for Predictive Analytics in Urban Bike-Sharing Systems

This repository contains the implementation of my independent study on advanced graph-based deep learning for predictive analytics in urban bike-sharing systems. The study focuses on predicting bike demand using advanced Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to enhance the efficiency and reliability of urban bike-sharing systems.

## Project Overview

- [**Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN):**](https://github.com/srushtii-m/Citibike-Demand-Prediction-Using-GCN-s/tree/main/STGCN) Captures spatial and temporal dependencies through graph convolutions and gated temporal convolutions.
- [**Attention Based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ASTGCN):**](https://github.com/srushtii-m/Citibike-Demand-Prediction-Using-GCN-s/tree/main/ASTGCN) Incorporates attention mechanisms to dynamically focus on important spatial and temporal features.
- [**Spatio-Temporal Neural Structural Causal Models (STNSCM):**](https://github.com/srushtii-m/Citibike-Demand-Prediction-Using-GCN-s/tree/main/STNSCM) Integrates causal reasoning and counterfactual analysis to improve the robustness and adaptability of predictions.

## Report

For a detailed exploration of the methodologies and results, you can refer to the full report [here](https://github.com/srushtii-m/Citibike-Demand-Prediction-Using-GCN-s/blob/main/Report.pdf).

## Ongoing Research

I am continuing my research on the GCN methodology to further refine and enhance predictive analytics in urban bike-sharing systems. Future work will focus on integrating real-time data and additional variables such as weather conditions and special events to improve prediction accuracy and system management.
